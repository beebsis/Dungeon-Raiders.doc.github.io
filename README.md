# Dungeon Raiders

This is a site made for Dungeon Raiders on Twitch, developed by Ero to keep a clean a nice documentation. Fixes the players problems when it comes to navigating through the currency docs.

## Change of Plans!
GitHub Pages only supports purely static website, we thought that maybe we could use .json to make some stuff easier than usual. However, since CORS isn't allowed/enabled, then we're unable to do so and would require a different service if it was.
Another option would be to host this on my own website atm, then we could pretty much do as we're pleased. But 1 problem at a time.

> Things are still bound to change after they've been made due to user input.
