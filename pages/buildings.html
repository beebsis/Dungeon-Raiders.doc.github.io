                        The Inn is also where the food and gold is kept, level up the building to have more room for ever-increasing expenses.

                        Upgrades increase item quality and reduce their price.
                        The first 3 upgrades will unlock more selling slots.
                        There is no upgrade limit

                    <p>
                        The academy is where you get your talents. You need talent points to use them

                    <h2>Shop</h2>
                    <p>
                        Here you can upgrade your items (on the orange forge). In order to get forging materials, you must raid and get items. When raid items are not equipped by anyone, they will automatically get recycled to the orange forge, giving you forging materials of each type. Higher tier items will fill up the forge faster, but every item gives materials for every tier upgrade. 
                        You can upgrade this building and each time increase the amount of materials you get per item, as well as unlocking higher tier upgrades.
                        After you upgrade the forge to level 13 you will also be able to reforge relics (the green forge will appear)
                        Both forges are active when they are full and have a white outline.
                        And if you have the required gold for the upgrade, you will successfully upgrade your item or make a relic

                    </p>

                    <h2>Guild Hall</h2>
                    <p>
                        This building will give you access to quests. There are 3 guilds: miners, hunters and farmers. Everytime someone participates in a quest, it will contribute to level up the guild that gave you that quest (white outline on the guild icon).
                        Quest rewards will have bonuses for those that completed their contribution bar for that quest (white text reward + cyan text reward). If you haven’t participated at all, or haven’t filled your contribution bar, you will receive the white text reward only. Contribution will reset every time a new quest is given, but you can fill it additional times to earn the specific guild extra XP and get yourself more honor.
                        At Guild Hall level 10, you unlock Reward Chests, which will be available to open every 12h. You can increase the loot in Reward Chests by completing quests and filling contribution bars. There are 3 different chests at once, and you can only open 1 out of the 3, but at Guild Hall level 20 you unlock a 2nd token, and lastly the 3rd one at Guild Hall level 30, allowing you to open all Reward Chests.
