                            Note that there are 2 types of damage: physical damage and special damage:
                            Physical damage gets reduced by the target’s armor, and can also result in a dodge or a critical hit, as well as benefiting from lifesteal.
                            Special damage cannot critically strike, be dodged, or apply lifesteal, but it will ignore 50% of the target’s armor.
                            Additionally, there are status effects: bleed and poison:
                            Bleed deals 10% of the target’s max HP over 3 seconds and reduces its healing by 50%, it can not stack with other bleed fonts, in case that happens, the 3 second timer will reset but no damage will be added. Bleed damage does not get reduced by armor.
                            Poison also deals damage over time, but unlike bleeding it can stack multiple times, not resetting the duration but adding the damage. Poison will also slow its target, and will ignore 50% of the target’s armor. Each stack lasts 5s.
                            Status effects do not count as special damage.
